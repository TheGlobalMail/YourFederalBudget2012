	<p>Defence Minister Stephen Smith showed a nice touch with euphemism in his overview of his department&rsquo;s Budget this year. Defence, he said, would make “contributions" to the government&rsquo;s “broader fiscal strategy [of] $971 million in 2012-13”.</p><p>

Put more plainly, military spending was being heavily pruned as the government cut costs to deliver on its promise of a surplus budget. Over the forward estimates — the three years beyond this one — the total "contribution" was predicted to be $5.454 billion.</p><p>

Still, Australia&rsquo;s war machine remains pretty well-oiled; its total Budget for this year is $24.1 billion.</p><p>

This includes an additional $1.3 billion to fund operations in Afghanistan and the Middle East this year, on top of previously approved funding of $439 million. Over the past three years, opinion polls have consistently shown a majority of Australians want out of Afghanistan. Put plainly, the government has continued to spend billions of dollars on a military campaign which most people oppose. But the numbers show we are at last disengaging.</p><p>

Then there was another $130 million for peacekeeping operations in East Timor and the Solomon Islands. Not to mention $9.5 million in 2012‑13 for  “Operation Resolute” — as they call the military contribution to dealing with boat people, that will surely blow out given the increased arrival numbers. Also among the spending priorities for the year:  $100 million additional investment in “sustainment” of the trouble-plagued Collins Class submarines;  $89 million for information technology “remediation activities”; and another $89 million for general Navy “fleet sustainment”.</p><p>

Against this were cost savings, noted in the forward estimates from the cancellation or deferral of various spending items, the largest being  $900 million from a two-year delay in acquiring 12 new F35 joint strike fighters from America, whose development is in any case, delayed.</p>
