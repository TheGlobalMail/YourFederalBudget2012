	<p>The federal government will spend $5.2 billion on overseas aid for 2012-13, which equals about 1.38 per cent of the total budget, or 0.35 per cent of gross national income (GNI) – the measure normally used to compare aid allocations between countries.</p><p>
The government deferred by one year its commitment to increase the aid budget to 0.5 per cent of GNI; it was to have happened by 2015-16, but now is the target for the following financial year. This change – one of a raft of penny-pinching measures implemented so Wayne Swan could claim to have achieved a (tissue thin) budget surplus --saved the government $2.9 billion over four years.</p><p>
This was the second time this government has broken its promise to increase the GNI share of aid. In 2009-10, it promised 0.4 per cent by this year.</p><p>
Nonetheless, the amount devoted to aid has increased significantly over the past decade, under both this government and the previous Howard Government. In 2003-4 the aid budget was just 0.25 per cent of GNI.</p><p>
Foreign aid, apart from its humanitarian value, is also seen as a means of exercising ‘soft power’ in the world and particular in our region. On the other hand, the accepted political wisdom is that there few if any votes in aid.</p>
