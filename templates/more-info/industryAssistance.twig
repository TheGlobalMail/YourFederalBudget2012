	<p>There are so many various schemes to help business either directly or through tax breaks that it is almost impossible to tally them all. Two years ago, the Productivity Commission attempted to collate them and reached a total, for both direct assistance and tax breaks, of some $9 billion.</p><p>
But it’s hard. There are numerous little things, worth a million or a few million, with descriptors like “Accelerated depreciation for grapevine plantings” or “Tax write-off for horticultural plants,”
or “Three year write-off for expenditure on water facilities for primary producers”.</p><p>
Then there are bigger items like the break for mining companies’ exploration and prospecting efforts -- worth $320 this year, and the capital gains tax exemption for small business owners who sell up when they retire – worth $380 million.</p><p>
For our purposes today, we’ll take two of the more contentious, including one of the biggest. The Fuel Tax Credit scheme will cost the government $5.6 billion this financial year. About 40 per cent, or $2 billion of the benefit of the scheme, which makes fuel cheaper for certain users, will flow to mining companies. In the leadup to the budget, there was a push to cut this, led by the Greens, but it survived.</p><p>
The second big fuel and energy assistance scheme is categorised in the Budget as ‘Resources Related Initiatives and Management’ which goes to subsidise the production of fuel ethanol, a product whose benefits are controversial, and schemes to capture and store carbon, via technologies whose viability is widely questioned. They will cost the government a further$362 million this year, rising to an estimated $670 million in 2015-16.</p><p>
Another $269 million is devoted to “assisting the most emissions‑intensive coal mines to transition to a carbon price.”
</p><p>
Apart from the mining companies receiving 40% of the $5.6 billion through the FTC scheme, it looks like the 60% balance will go to a variety of industries because the fuel tax credits can be claimed by a range of businesses.
</p><p>
In addition to the $362 million being spent on ‘Resources Related Initiatives and Management’ subsidising the production of fuel ethanol, $293 million will go to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), which commenced on 1 July 2012.  ARENA will administer a range of Government renewable energy projects (mainly R&D), including some previously administered by the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism.
</p><p>
In total, that’s $6.23 billion this year, spent subsidising activities which generate greenhouse gases. In comparison, the government allocated $293 to the development of other non-fossil fuel energy sources through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.</p>
